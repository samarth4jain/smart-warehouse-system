# Smart Warehouse Dashboard - Fixed and Working

## What Was Fixed

### Backend Issues
1. **Missing Dependencies**: Installed required FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and other backend dependencies
2. **Database Initialization**: Fixed table creation issues and successfully created the SQLite database
3. **Sample Data**: Added sample products and inventory data for testing
4. **API Endpoints**: All dashboard API endpoints are now working:
   - `/api/dashboard/overview` - Returns inventory metrics and operation counts
   - `/api/dashboard/inventory-alerts` - Returns low stock alerts
   - `/api/dashboard/recent-activity` - Returns recent warehouse activities

### Frontend Issues
1. **API Connection**: Fixed JavaScript to use correct API base URL (`/api` for relative paths)
2. **Dashboard Routes**: Added proper backend routes to serve dashboard HTML files
3. **CORS Issues**: Resolved by serving frontend through the same backend server
