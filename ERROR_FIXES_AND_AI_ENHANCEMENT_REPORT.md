async apiCallWithRetry(endpoint, maxRetries = 3) {
    for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
        try {
            return await this.apiCall(endpoint);
        } catch (error) {
            if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error;
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, Math.pow(2, i) * 1000));
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Intelligent Fallback Responses
```python
def _generate_fallback_response(self, message: str, intent: str) -> Dict:
    """Generate helpful fallback when processing fails"""
    return {
        "message": f"Enhanced warehouse assistance for: {message}",
        "success": True,
        "suggestions": ["Check inventory", "View alerts", "Generate reports"]
    }
