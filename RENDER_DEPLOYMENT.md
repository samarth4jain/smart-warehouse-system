If you want just the frontend dashboard as a static site:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy frontend only
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Render build fails:
1. Check build logs in Render dashboard
2. Try manual deploy trigger
3. Verify all files are pushed to GitHub

### If app doesn't start:
1. Check the "Logs" tab in Render
2. Ensure start command is correct: `./start_render.sh`
3. Verify environment variables are set

### Common fixes:
- Build timeout → Use lighter requirements.txt
- Memory issues → Restart service in Render dashboard
- Database issues → Check logs for SQLite permissions
